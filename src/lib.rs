//!# Maths Traits
//!
//!A simple crate for sane and usable abstractions of common (and uncommon) mathematical constructs
//!using the Rust trait system
//!
//!# Design Philosophy
//!
//!The framework in this crate is written to fit four design goals:
//!* Traits should be flexible and assume as much mathematical abstraction as possible.
//!* Trait names, functions, and categorization should fit their corresponding
//! mathematical conventions.
//!* Usage must be simple enough so that working with these generics instead of primitives add
//! minimal complication
//!* Implementation should utilize the [standard Rust][std::ops] or well established
//! libraries (such as [`num_traits`]) as much as possible instead of creating new systems
//! requiring significant special attention to support.
//!
//!# Usage
//!
//!The traits in this framework are split into two collections, one for individual features and mathematical
//!properties and one for common mathematical structures, where the second set of traits is automatically
//!implemented by grouping together functionality from the first set. This way, to support the system,
//!structs need only implement each relevant property, and end users can simply use the single
//!trait for whichever mathematical struct fits their needs.
//!
//!For example, to implement the [algebraic](algebra) features for a `Rational` type,
//!you would implement [`Clone`](Clone), [`Add`](std::ops::Add), [`Sub`](std::ops::Sub), [`Mul`](std::ops::Mul),
//![`Div`](std::ops::Div), [`Neg`](std::ops::Neg), [`Inv`](num_traits::Inv), [`Zero`](num_traits::Zero),
//![`One`](num_traits::One), and their assign variants as normal. Then, by implementing the new traits
//![`AddCommutative`](algebra::AddCommutative), [`AddAssociative`](algebra::AddAssociative),
//![`MulCommutative`](algebra::MulCommutative), [`MulCommutative`](algebra::MulAssociative), and
//![`Distributive`](algebra::Distributive), all of the categorization traits (such as [`Ring`](algebra::Ring)
//!and [`MulMonoid`](algebra::MulMonoid)) will automatically be implemented and usable for our type.
//!

//!# Supported Constructs
//!
//!Currently, the mathematical structures supported in `math_traits` consist of a system of
//![group-like](algebra::group_like), [ring-like](algebra::ring_like), [integer-like](algebra::integer),
//!and [module-like](algebra::module_like) algebraic structures and a system of analytical constructions including
//![ordered and Archimedean groups](analysis::ordered), [real and complex numbers](analysis::real),
//!and [metric and inner product spaces](analysis::metric). For more information, see each respective
//!module.
//!
//!# Release Stability
//!
//!At the moment, this project is considered to be in Alpha, so expect to see changes
//!to the API in the near future. As it stands, however, these changes almost
//!certainly will centered around the `analysis` module, with a couple
//!minor tweaks to `integer` and `module_like`. Hence, on that note,
//!I would actually consider much of the `algebra` module,
//!especially `group_like` and `ring_like`, to be mostly stable, though not guaranteed.
//!
//!Once the general API is stable, the crate will probably signify this with an
//!update to version 0.2.0.
