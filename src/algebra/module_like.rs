///
///A product between two vectors or module elements resulting in a scalar that is semi-linear in both arguments
///
///Rigorously, a σ-sesquilinear form is a mapping `•:M⨯M->R` from a Ring Module to its base ring such that:
/// * `(x + y)•z = x•z + y•z`
/// * `x•(y + z) = x•y + x•y`
/// * `(c*x)•y = c*(x•y)`
/// * `x•(c*y) = (x•y)*σ(c)` where `σ:R->R` is some anti-automorphism, usually the complex conjugate
///   or the identity map
///
/// # Notes on Definition
///
///It is additionally worth emphasizing that in general, while there are a number of other properties
///commonly added to this list, none of them should be assumed without the addition of the appropriate
///marker trait. In particular:
/// * `x•(c*y)` may not equal `(x•y)*c`
/// * `x•y` may not equal `y•x`
/// * `x•y = 0` does not necessarily imply `y•x = 0`
///
///However, if these properties are desired, then the following additional traits can be implemented
///or used:
/// * [ReflexiveForm]: `x•y = 0` implies `y•x = 0`
///     * as a consequence, [Orthogonality](SesquilinearForm::orthogonal) becomes a reflexive property
/// * [SymSesquilinearForm]: `σ(x•y) = y•x`
/// * [SkewSesquilinearForm]: `σ(x•y) = -y•x`
/// * [BilinearForm]: `x•(c*y) = (x•y)*c`, ie, `σ(x) = x` for all `x`
///     * If also a [SymSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = y•x`
///     * If also a [SkewSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = -y•x`
/// * [ComplexSesquilinearForm]: `x•(c*y) = (x•y)*c̅`, ie `R ⊆ ℂ` and `σ(x) = x̅` for all `x`
///     * If also a [SymSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = conj(y•x)`
///     * If also a [SkewSesquilinearForm], this implies `x•y = -conj(y•x)`
///
/// # Examples
///
/// * Dot product of finite dimensional spaces and modules: `x•y = Σ(xₖ*yₖ)`
/// * Inner Product of real and complex vector spaces of any dimension
/// * Complex and Hyper-complex moduli: `z*w̅`
/// * The "Cross-Product" in 2D real-vector spaces: `x₁*y₂ - x₂*y₁`
///     * Alternatively, the mapping taking two vectors to the determinant of the matrix with
///      the vectors as its columns
/// * Minkowski metric: `ds² = dx² + dy² + dz² - dt²`
/// * Scalar product of the conformal model of Geometric algebra
